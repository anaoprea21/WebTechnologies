News App

This web application was made to give the students a voice. There will be two roles, that of a reporter, that can create stories and articles, and a seeker (of knowledge), that will simply read those articles. Some actions that a user will be able to do on this app are creating an article, seeing how many users have read said article and create a story, which will contain more than one descriptive article.

Features:

1. Create an account. The user will choose what type of account they want, reporter or seeker. A reporter will provide their pseudonym, that will be attached to the articles, an email, a password and a username. The seeker will provide a username, email and password. 

2. Creating an article. the reporter will provide a title, the text, the title of the story(if the article referes to one) and a location (optional). After writing it, the user will have to choose if they want to post it for the seekers or to post it for other reporters, to receive feedback.

3. Choosing posting it for reporters only, the article will become a pending article. After at least one other reporter gives the ok, the article will become approved. A reporter can give feedback about an pending article. The pending article doesn't have to be approved for it to be posted. The reporter can port it for the seekers at any time.
